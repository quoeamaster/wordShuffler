The department expressed its “deep regret” over the transport operator’s attitude in response to a written account submitted by the company on Tuesday evening about excavation work at Exhibition Centre Station.

It also voiced dissatisfaction at a series of scandals involving three stops on the line and blasted MTR and contractors for putting “the public’s safety at risk”.

“It is totally unacceptable that the MTR Corp has repeatedly failed to timely notify the Highways Department of incidents related to the construction of Hung Hom Station, To Kwa Wan Station and Exhibition Centre Station,” it said.

According to the department, it learned of the three scandals only after receiving media inquiries.
